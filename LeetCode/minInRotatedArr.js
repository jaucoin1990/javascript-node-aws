// Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:
// [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
// [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
// Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
// Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
// You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
